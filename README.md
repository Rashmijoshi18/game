🧠 About the Game


Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet addictive game where two players (X and O) take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
This project is a digital version of the classic game, perfect for learning basic programming logic, UI design, and game development principles.
